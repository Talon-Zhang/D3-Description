A.	Does the narrative visualization correctly follow the hybrid structure as stated by the essay?

I have used the structure of interactive slideshow to do my narrative visualization. After arriving at the homepage, the user can click on the buttons on the tag bar to go through the slides corresponding to different time.

B.	Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize scenes?

There are four main slides each with a graph in the website, with one homepage and one conclusion page, which construct of six scenes. The main slides are ordered by the time of the events. They follow a template for visual consistency by positioning the graphs in the same position followed by text under it. All of the graphs are quite straight forward line graphs with time as x-axis and price as y-axis, in order to show how prices change over time.

C.	Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize annotations?

In each graph, there is one red arrow indicating the highest price in that period. There is also the time of the event on the tag bar above and the top price colored red in the middle. This is the same for every graph so it follows visual consistency, and the arrows highlight specific data items. When another slide is chosen, all the annotations will be replaced.

D.	Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize parameters?

There are four states in my visualization corresponding to four events. Each state has different parameters â€“ different time periods and different scale of the prices. The line chart is able to show how the price change over time. When differnt slide is chosen, all parameters change.

E.	Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize triggers?

There are basically two triggers in my visualization. 
The first one is the button on the tag bar. It changes the time for the slide therefore triggers the change of the graph and text. When the users hang their mouses on the bar, the button will become a little whiter, so that they know they can click on the button. The second one is the tooltips on each graph. If the user hang their mouses on any data point in the graph, the x-axis and y-axis value will appear immediately. If they then remove their mouses, the information will disapeear automatically. I have made the point especially big so that users can easily find this function.
